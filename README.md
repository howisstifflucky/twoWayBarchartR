# twoWayBarchartR
## A simple R script for creating a 2x2 barchart themed to APA standard.
----
In order to create a barchart, all you need do is set your working directory, 
change FILENAME to whatever you're working with, and rename IV1, IV2 and DV 
to the variables you're attempting to plot.

Embarrassingly, this took quite a while to make! I hope it can be useful for you. :)
